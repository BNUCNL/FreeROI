The files here are used to build an exectable version of FreeROI on Windows platform based on pyinstaller 2.0.

Before building the exe file, we should copy the files in directory `support/rthooks` into directory `pyinstaller/support` and update the file rthooks.dat.

File freeroi.spec is used to configure the building process. Copy this file into the directory `pyinstaller/freeroi`.

Enter into the pyinstaller directory, run the command python pyinstaller.py freeroi/freeroi/spec in the cmd.exe to build the exectable version.

Finally, copy the file skimage._shared.transfrom.pyd into the dist directory.
