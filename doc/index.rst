Welcome to FreeROI's documentation!
===================================

FreeROI is a versatile image processing software developed for neuroimaging
data. Its goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for neuroimaging
researchers to visualize and analyze their data, especially in defining region
of interest (ROI) for ROI analysis.

Currently, FreeROI could run on multiple platforms, including:

* Ubuntu/Debian
* CentOS/Redhat/Fedora
* Mac OSX
* Windows

For Windows users, an exectable version is
`available <http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeroi/files/?source=navbar>`_.
Unzip the package, double click *freeroi.exe* to run the program.

For other users, a guide about how to install is available on
`FreeROI@Github <https://github.com/BNUCNL/FreeROI>`_.
