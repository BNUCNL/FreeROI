Introduction
============

FreeROI is a versatile image processing software developed for neuroimaging
data. Its goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for neuroimaging
researchers to visualize and analyze their data, especially in defining `region
of interest <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_of_interest>`_ (ROI) for ROI
analysis.

Features
---------

As its name revealed, FreeROI is focused on the region of interest data analysis
method.
It has:

* Powerful ROI generating and labeling methods, and the corresponding toolset
  and pipelines, which could be used to reliably and efficiently creating ROIs
  specifically for multi-modal neuroimaging analysis (eg. fMRI, Resting, 
  DTI...), see :ref:`ROI Generation <roi-generation>`

* Two modes to view and explore neuroimage data, including a sigle-orientation
  slicing viewer, and a three-orientation slicing viewer. A 3D volume viewer
  would also be available in the near future. For details see :ref:`Data Viewing
  <data-viewing>`
  
* A bunch of data processing tools to manipulate and analyzing neuroimage data,
  see :ref:`Data Analysis Toolset <data-analysis-toolkit>`

* Support for both 3D and 4D neuroimage data, which is very useful for batch
  processing, see :ref:`Data format <data-format>`

FreeROI is currently under active developing and maintaning by a group of 
experienced neuroimage data analysists, the following are some upcoming 
features:

* more ROI statistical analysis functions
* more automatic ROI generating functions based on machine learning strategies
* support for surface neuroimaging data format
